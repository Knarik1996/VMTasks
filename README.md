Here will be the trials (in terms of coding) that I am about to have before being accepted by VMWare.

For today my task was to figure out which sorting method to choose for unsorted array that could also have duplicate numbers in it.

I have chosen the algorithm of Binary Heap as it is really stable and it works fast with large arrays (for examples Quicksort could also be fine but it is not stable).

Time complexity for Binary Heap is O(nLogn) which is actually pretty good.

Also maybe the choice for this method was mainly because of my familiarity with it (as in ML I usually used binary tree approaches).
